  s.description  = <<-DESC
The **mimik Client Library** is a unified SDK that embeds and manages **mimik OE** â€” a lightweight mimik operating environment enabling developers to build, deploy, and orchestrate microservices and AI-powered workflows across hybrid edge-cloud systems.

It abstracts away the complexities of:
- OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication
- Edge node discovery and orchestration
- Lifecycle and configuration management for microservices
- AI model integration, streaming prompts, and unified outputs.
