 The purpose of the mimik Client Library for iOS is to provide a programmatic way to work with the edgeEngine Runtime to access information about the mobile device on which the application is running, as well as mobile devices running within a cluster of mobile devices that are hosting the edgeEngine Runtime. Also, to allow developers to use edge microservices running within a particular cluster.

The mimik Client Library for iOS suite consists of three individual cocoapod components:
    - EdgeCore
    - EdgeEngine (or EdgeEngineDeveloper)
    - EdgeUser
