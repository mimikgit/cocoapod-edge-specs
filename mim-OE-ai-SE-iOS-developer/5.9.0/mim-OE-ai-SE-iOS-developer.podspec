  s.description  = <<-DESC
The mimik Client Library provides a low-level, programmatic interface for interacting with the mim OE Runtime (formerly known as the edge engine).

Quick Start:

- Onboarding Tutorial
    Step-by-step setup and usage guide:
    https://devdocs.mimik.com/tutorials/01-submenu/02-submenu/02-index

- API Documentation
    Complete reference for available classes, methods, and usage patterns:
    https://mimikgit.github.io/cocoapod-EdgeCore/documentation/edgecore/edgecore

Features:

The library exposes functionality to:

- Initialize and configure the mim OE Runtime, including local runtime setup, configuration loading, and lifecycle management
- Discover and interact with nodes in a Hybrid Edge Cloud cluster using built-in discovery and service registration APIs
- Deploy and manage RESTful microservices on the edge cloud node using a lightweight container abstraction
- Authenticate and authorize developers and services using token-based flows (OAuth2, JWT)
- (Optional) Integrate with on-device AI runtimes, allowing local invocation of Vision and Language models without requiring cloud access

Runtime Characteristics:

- Written for resource-constrained environments
- Supports offline-first and peer-to-peer communication paradigms
- Built for decentralized orchestration across edge cloud nodes in distributed environments

Use Case Examples:

- Register and expose a microservice on a local node
- Query cluster topology and fetch metadata from peer nodes
- Secure communication between services using tokens
- (Optional) Launch a local AI model for image or text inference

This library is intended for developers building distributed edge cloud native apps where network reliability, low-latency processing, and on-device compute are critical.
