- Authentication: OAuth2/JWT flows, developer console login/signup, token exchange, and session management
- Edge node discovery & orchestration: auto-discovery, routing, and service registration across clusters
- Microservice lifecycle management: deploy, scale, update, and remove services dynamically
- AI integration: unified interface to query device, edge, and cloud models, with streaming prompts and standardized outputs
- Developer Console integration: prebuilt authentication views, application APIs, and ID token handling
